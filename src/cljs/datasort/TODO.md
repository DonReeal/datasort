# TODOS


## Sorting

* [x] API based on passing functions (DONE: criteriasort2)
* [x] API for declaring comparators on single properties (DONE: criteriasort2)


## Table-UI

* [x] render table fn based on data (DONE: core/render-table)
* [x] find a table ui-model with minimal state to allow for declaring sorting by multiple columns

        * Sorting by a column should put nils last in natural order
        * For each column a user must be able to toggle natural and reverse order
        * Sorting by multiple columns should be configurable by interacting with the table itself (no config dialogue)
* [x] Build initial state with minimal user input (ident-fn, records)
* [x] Integrate UI-state to render on toggle column order            
* [ ] build [<|******|>] shift ui-component  (wrapper-component)
* [x] integrate shift with reordering columns, update sort order accordingly
* [ ] build [:asc|:desc] toggle ui-component (leaf-component) [toggle component talk](https://youtu.be/b_uum_iYShE?t=486)
